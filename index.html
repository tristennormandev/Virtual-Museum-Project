                <p class="lead text-white">
                  The Anti-War Movement that began in response to the Vietnam War during the late 1960s and early 1970s marked an extreme cultural and political shift in the United States. As American involvement in Vietnam escalated, so too did public outcry. What began as small-scale protests on college campuses quickly evolved into a nationwide movement involving students, civil rights activists, veterans, and artists from all backgrounds, genders, ages, and nationalities. This wave of diverse activism not only questioned the legitimacy and morality of the war itself but also challenged broader aspects of American political and social life, including government transparency, military-industrial influence, and civil liberties through themes of unity, peace, and diversity.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  The Anti-War Movement was a defining shift in U.S. history for its international impact and how it reshaped the relationship between the American people and the government. The Anti-War Movement sparked an unprecedented level of civic engagement, with millions participating in protests and artistic demonstrations. This wave of cultural expression through music, art, and literature gave voice to widespread frustration and desire for change. The diversity and inclusion surrounding these protests and demonstrations bridged disconnected communities together and fostered cultural unity under the message of peace.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  This interactive virtual exhibit explores the Anti-War Movement through three primary sources in the formats of two photographs and a poster that offer a clear expression of the cultural narratives surrounding the era. These materials help illustrate the diverse voices and experiences that fueled the movement, revealing how regular Americans shaped history through activism and peaceful resistance. Furthermore, these artifacts serve to give insight into the key themes of unity, peace, and diversity that corner stoned the counterculture. While this exhibit serves to highlight the large-scale impact of the Anti-War Movement, this exhibit also serves to also express the significance of participation from small, local communities in changing the course of history. 
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  By engaging directly with these historical artifacts, viewers are invited to critically examine the motivations behind the protests, the responses from political leaders, and the lasting consequences for future movements. The Anti-War Movement not only altered the course of the Vietnam conflict but also transformed the American political climate leaving a legacy that continues to influence the course of activism and public discourse today. This exhibit aims to deepen the viewers' understanding of that legacy by bringing the voices of the past to life in a meaningful, simple, interactive, and immersive way.
